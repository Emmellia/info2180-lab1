 <h2>Emmellia Hayden</h2>
 <p>Hi, I'm Emmellia Hayden and I'm a second year student at the University of the West Indies.
I am a very goal-oriented and passionate person as it relates to my aspirations. <br>I love diversity and experiencing other 
cultures. I like getting different perspectives on the varying aspects of life. I love music and dance and my favourite past time is 
<br>reading and binge watching series. Career-wise I would like to have an established career in the field of computing whilst working on 
interior designing projects down the line.<br> I am interested in Web Development as I want to challenge myself as well as to learn and 
build my skill set. I am also exploring the different areas in computing that I would like <br>to specialise in and I think Web Development is an awesome area. </p>
